Project Overview
This project delves into an Airbnb dataset to uncover patterns and relationships related to pricing, room types, geographical distribution, and user engagement (reviews). The analysis aims to provide data-driven answers to crucial business questions, supporting strategic decisions for growth.

Dataset
(Provide a brief description of your dataset here. For example:)
The dataset used in this analysis is publicly available and contains information about Airbnb listings, including details such as listing prices, room types, neighborhood information, and review counts.

Key Questions Addressed
This analysis specifically tackles the following business questions:

What is the distribution of listing prices?

This section will explore the price range, common price points, and any outliers in the listing prices.

How are different room types distributed?

This will investigate the prevalence of 'Entire home/apt', 'Private room', 'Shared room', etc., within the dataset.

How are listings distributed across different neighborhoods?

This section will visualize and analyze the concentration of Airbnb listings in various neighborhoods.

What is the relationship between price and room type?

This analysis will examine how the average price varies across different room types.

How has the number of reviews changed over time?

This will track the trend of review counts to understand user engagement and listing popularity over time.

Analysis & Insights
(In this section, you would summarize your findings for each question. For example:)

Listing Price Distribution: Our analysis revealed that the majority of listings fall within the 

$ to
$ price range, with a few high-value outliers. Visualizations like histograms and box plots illustrate this distribution.

Room Type Distribution: 'Entire home/apt' is the most common room type, followed by 'Private room'. 'Shared room' makes up a smaller portion of the listings.

Neighborhood Distribution: Listings are heavily concentrated in [Neighborhood A] and [Neighborhood B], suggesting these are popular tourist or residential areas for Airbnb users.

Price vs. Room Type: As expected, 'Entire home/apt' generally commands higher prices compared to 'Private room' or 'Shared room'.

Reviews Over Time: The number of reviews has shown a [positive/negative/fluctuating] trend, indicating [increasing/decreasing] user engagement.
